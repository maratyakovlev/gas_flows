# gas_flows
**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**  
Aim of this project is to create a script that would allow to create a visualization of gas flow data.

**DATA SOURCE**  
Gas flow data are received from ENTSOG platform, it's publicly available source.  
https://www.entsog.eu/

**DETAILED DESCRIPTION, PROJECT GOAL**  
As s a start point I wanted to visualize gas flow data of newly built German LNG Terminals.  
This visualization would allow to show when the Terminals were comissioned and how each of them contribute to LNG import to Germany.  

Such visualizations could be used for some market reports, for example.  
So, I think it's quite real example of a analysis task.  

In this project I wanted to practice my Python skills in terms of data manipulation and vizualisation.
I used following libraries during the project:  
- Pandas  
- Requests  
- io  
- matplotlib  

**PROJECT HISTORY**  
At first, I used downloaded csv files as a source.  
Then I added API requests to be able to download data directly from the source platform.
